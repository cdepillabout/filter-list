# filter-list

This is my own filter list for various things on the web.  Check the file [list.txt](./list.txt) for the details.

You can add this list to the ad-block browser extension you use by adding it via URL:

## Editing

When editing `list.txt`, **MAKE SURE TO BUMP THE `version` AT THE TOP OF THE FILE!**
